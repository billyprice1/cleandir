cleandir
========

Super duper small script using inotify to find closed files and delete them
once they're closed. Useful for instantly removing files uploaded to an ftp
server (for speedtest purposes) as to not fill up the file system.

Usage
-----
Modify the WATCH_DIR in the source and then just run the script with something
like `cleandir.py &`. Perhaps put it in some startup file so it is started on
boot.

Todo
----
Should be able to daemonize and configure it, perhaps through command line args?
